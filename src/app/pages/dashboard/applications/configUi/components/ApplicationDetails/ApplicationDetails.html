              A successful peer review strategy for <a href="https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/what-is-code-review/"
                                                       target="_blank">code review</a> requires balance between strictly documented processes and a non-threatening,
              collaborative environment. Highly regimented peer reviews can stifle productivity, yet lackadaisical processes
              are often ineffective. Managers are responsible for finding a middle ground where peer review can be efficient
              and effective while fostering open communication and knowledge-share between teammates.
            </p>
            <h4>THESE 10 TIPS WILL GUIDE YOU TOWARD EFFECTIVE PEER CODE REVIEW</h4>
            <h5> 1. Review fewer than 400 lines of code at a time</h5>
            <p>A study by the Cisco Systems programming team revealed that developers should review no more than 200 to 400
              lines of code (LOC) at a time. The brain can only effectively process so much information at a time; beyond
              400 LOC, the ability to find defects diminishes</p>
            <h4> 2. Take your time. Inspection rates should under 500 LOC per hour</h4>
            <p>t can be tempting to tear through a review, assuming that someone else will catch the errors that you don´t
              find. However, SmartBear research shows a significant drop in defect density at rates faster than 500 LOC
              per hour. Code reviews in reasonable quantity, at a slower pace for a limited amount of time results in the
              most effective code review.</p>
            <h4>.3 Do not review for more than 60 minutes at a time</h4>
            <p>Just as you shouldn´t review code too quickly, you also should not review for too long in one sitting. When
              people engage in any activity requiring concentrated effort over a period of time, performance starts dropping
              off after about 60 minutes. Studies show that taking breaks from a task over a period of time can greatly
              improve quality of work.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Set goals and capture metrics</h4>
            <p>Before implementing a process, your team should decide how you will measure the effectiveness of peer review
              and name a few tangible goals.
            </p>
            <p>Realistically, only automated or strictly controlled processes can provide repeatable metrics. A metrics-driven
              code review tool gathers data automatically so that your information is accurate and without human bias.</p>
            <h4> 5. Authors should annotate source code before the review</h4>
            <p>Authors should annotate code before the review occurs because annotations guide the reviewer through the changes,
              showing which files to look at first and defending the reason behind each code modification. Annotations
              should be directed at other reviewers to ease the process and provide more depth in context. As an added
              benefit, the author will often find additional errors before the peer review even begins. More bugs found
              prior to peer review will yield in lower defect density because fewer bugs exist overall.
            </p>
            <h4> 6. Use checklists</h4>
            <p>It´s very likely that each person on your team makes the same 10 mistakes over and over. Omissions in particular
              are the hardest defects to find because it´s difficult to review something that isn´t there. Checklists are
              the most effective way to eliminate frequently made errors and to combat the challenges of omission finding.</p>
            <h4>7. Establish a process for fixing defects found</h4>
            <p>Even after optimizing code review processes by time-boxing reviews, limiting LOC reviewed per hour and naming
              key metrics for your team, there´s still a key review step missing. How will the bugs be fixed? It seems
              obvious, but many teams do not have a systematic method for fixing the bugs they´ve worked so hard to find.</p>
            <p>The best way to ensure that defects are fixed is to use a <a href="https://smartbear.com/product/collaborator/overview/"
                                                                            target="_blank"><b>collaborative
              code review tool</b></a> that allows reviewers to log bugs, discuss them with the author, and approve changes
              in the code. Without an automated tool, bugs found in review likely aren´t logged in the team´s usual defect
              tracking system because they are found before code is released to QA.
            </p>
            <h4>8. Foster a positive code review culture</h4>
            <p>Peer review can put strain on interpersonal team relationships. It´s difficult to have every piece of work
              critiqued by peers and to have management evaluating and measuring defect density in your code. Therefore,
              in order for peer code review to be successful, it´s extremely important that mangers create a culture of
              collaboration and learning in peer review</p>
            <p>While it´s easy to see defects as purely negative, each bug is actually an opportunity for the team to improve
              code quality. Peer review also allows junior team members to learn from senior leaders and for even the most
              experienced programmers to break bad habits.</p>
            <p>Defects found in peer review are not an acceptable rubric by which to evaluate team members. Reports pulled
              from peer code reviews should never be used in performance reports. If personal metrics become a basis for
              compensation or promotion, developers will become hostile toward the process and naturally focus on improving
              personal metrics rather than writing better overall code.</p>
            <h4>9. Embrace the subconscious implications of peer review</h4>
            <p>The knowledge that others will be examining their work naturally drives people to produce a better product.
              This "Ego Effect" naturally incentivizes developers to write cleaner code because their peers will certainly
              see it. The SmartBear study of Cisco Systems found that "spot checking" 20% to 33% of the code resulted in
              lower defect density with minimal time expenditure. If your code has a 1-in-3 chance of being called out
              for review, that´s enough of an incentive to double-check your work.</p>
            <h4>10. Practice lightweight code reviews</h4>
            <p>Between email, over-the-shoulder, Microsoft Word, tool-assisted and hybrids of all types there are countless
              ways to collaboratively review code. However, to fully optimize your team´s time and to effectively measure
              its results, a lightweight, tool-assisted process is recommended.</p>
